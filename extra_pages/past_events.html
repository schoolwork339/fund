            <p>Relay for life began in the USA in May 1985 when colorectal surgeon, Dr. Gordy Klatt, wanted to raise awareness of cancer and boost the income of his local cancer charity. He spent a gruelling twenty-four hours circulating a track in Tacoma, Washington, and raised over US$27,000, and showed that one person really can make a difference. 


            </p>
            <p>Relay for Life began in Australia in 1999 with the relay at Murrumbeena, Victoria raising approximately $75, 000 for the cancer council. Relay for life is now held in every state with hundreds of thousands of people participating each time with millions raised every year.  


            </p>
            <p>The more events that relay for life hold the more donations they receive and the more donations they receive, the more research can be done to make sure that those with cancer can live better lives. Some recent advances that they have made due to the relay for life include newfound lung cancer resistances and new forms of therapy for people to help cope with cancer. So, we should all help the Cancer council to unite these communities to help the cause.
